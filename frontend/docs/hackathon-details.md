Agentic Commerce on Arc
Build agentic payment experiences with USDC
In this hybrid hackathon powered by Arc and Circle, developers will build the next generation of agentic commerce systems on Arc with USDC. Explore a world where AI agents and web services can pay for APIs, data, compute, and content in dynamic, usage-based ways, while Arc provides stablecoin-native settlement with predictable USDC fees and deterministic, sub-second finality.



This hackathon is supported by Google & Google DeepMind, with a dedicated challenge and $10,000 in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) credits awarded for the best use of Gemini models and Google AI Studio.



📅 January 9 – 24, 2026

CHALLENGE
Build the next generation of agentic commerce on Arc using USDC, Gateway, and Circle infrastructure.

Your mission is to design and ship an application, agent, or developer tool that showcases how autonomous systems can coordinate, pay, and transact onchain using Arc and Circle products. You’ll choose one of the tracks below (or naturally align to one) and submit a working demo plus a clear explanation of your use case.



🪙 Best Gateway-Based Micropayments Integration

Create an application that uses Gateway-based micropayments (x402 or otherwise) to enable usage-based payment flows.



🤖 Best Trustless AI Agent
Build a trust-minimized autonomous agent that incorporates identity, policies, guardrails, and onchain treasury logic.



🛒 Best Autonomous Commerce Application
Develop a compelling buyer or seller application demonstrating autonomous commerce powered by onchain payments.



🧰 Best Dev Tools
Create SDKs, libraries, or infrastructure that accelerate building autonomous commerce experiences with Gateway and Arc.



🧱 Best Vibecoded Application 

Build with beta access to Circle's AI App Builder

Note: Access to Circle’s AI App Builder (beta) and products under NDA is limited to participants who request access during registration and complete registration by Friday, 9th of January, 12:00 PM PST (San Francisco) / 9:00 PM CET. Eligible participants will receive onboarding instructions directly. After this deadline, the option to request access will be closed, while registration and submissions for all other tracks will remain open.



🎨 Best Product Design
Best UI/UX integration for onchain agentic payments, showcasing seamless transactions and intuitive user flows.

Technology & Access
To build your project, you will use Arc (settlement layer), USDC (value), and Circle developer infrastructure such as Gateway, App Builder, and x402 (web-native payment standard) where available.

Some capabilities will be offered to hackathon participants through an early access program.

🔒 Required Technologies:
• Arc - All transactions settle on Arc, an EVM-compatible Layer-1.
• USDC - USDC is the native gas token and stablecoin on Arc and is used for gas fees, transfers, and smart contract interactions.


 

🔒 Additional Recommended Technologies:
• Circle Wallets - Recommended core wallet solution for this hackathon.
Use Circle Wallets as the primary wallet infrastructure in your submission to create secure, programmable wallets for users and agents.
• Circle Gateway for a unified USDC balance instantly accessible crosschain
• Circle Bridge Kit for moving USDC across chains
• x402 facilitator for verifying and submitting x402 payments
(Use the tools that best fit your track and product. Some capabilities, including Arc App Builder and Circle Gateway, will be provided via early access.)




🧪 Early access to new Circle tooling:
As part of this hackathon, participants will have the unique opportunity to gain early access to new Circle tooling designed to enable and accelerate AI-powered development. These capabilities are being made available to hackathon participants ahead of broader release.

More details will be provided in the registration form when you complete your signup. We’re excited to see how you leverage these emerging tools as you innovate on top of Circle’s platform.




 

🧰 Developer Resources:

• Arc Documentation
• Circle Documentation 
• Circle Github
• Circle Developer Account
• Youtube
• Testnet faucet
• Circle Developer Blog

To get started, we highly encourage all participants to create a Circle Developer Account and use the same email they provide during hackathon registration. 
Technology partners





Gemini is Google’s family of next-generation multimodal AI modelsdesigned for agent-driven commerce, capable of reasoning across text, images, code, video, and audio. Gemini also supports Function Calling, allowing agents to securely interact with Circle APIs and smart contracts as part of real-world payment and settlement workflows.



Google AI Studio is a browser-based environment where developers and creators can easily explore and prototype with Gemini models - test prompts, refine outputs, and experiment with different modalities before integrating them into real-world applications through the Gemini API.





Build with Gemini models and Google AI Studio to power the intelligence and interface of your agents, then run them on Arc with USDC for agent-driven commerce.


Your project should:

• Use Gemini (via Google AI Studio or Gemini API) for reasoning, chat, or multimodal understanding, and Function Calling, enabling agents to interact directly with Circle APIs and smart contracts. 

• Run agent-driven or automated workflows that make decisions based on user input, data, or context.

• Coordinate and settle value on Arc with USDC using Circle infrastructure (e.g. Circle Wallets, Circle CCTP/Bridge Kit, Circle Gateway) as part of your commerce flow (subscriptions, usage-based APIs, tipping, marketplace payments, etc.).





Recommended Gemini Models:



Participants are encouraged to select the Gemini model that best fits their agent use case:


Gemini 3 Flash
Recommended for transactional and payment agents. Optimized for speed and low latency, making it ideal for real-time commerce flows such as checkout, payment execution, balance checks, and on-chain confirmations.



Gemini 3 Pro
Designed for advanced reasoning and “Deep Think” capabilities. Ideal for agents that need to negotiate prices, analyze complex transaction histories, manage treasuries, or coordinate multi-step financial workflows.





Multimodal Commerce Examples:





Gemini’s multimodal capabilities enable new forms of agent-driven commerce, such as:


• Using vision models to verify physical goods or delivery proof before releasing a USDC payment

• Analyzing invoice or receipt images to automate settlement, reconciliation, or refunds on Arc











Participants can explore Gemini through two main options - both include free access:

🌐 Google AI Studio: A free, browser-based IDE for experimenting with Gemini. You can write prompts, test outputs, tweak parameters, and prototype without needing to set up billing or any API keys. Perfect for prototyping and rapid iteration during the hackathon.

💻 Gemini API:  For developers ready to integrate Gemini directly into their apps. The free tier includes a monthly allowance of tokens for text and multimodal inputs/outputs, letting you test and build with Gemini’s core models at no cost. Paid usage only applies for higher-volume or production-level apps.

🔓 Google Cloud Credits:
New Google Cloud accounts receive $300 in free Google Cloud credits, valid for 90 days.
These credits can be used across eligible Google Cloud services, including Gemini API usage, subject to Google Cloud’s standard terms and regional availability.

👉 Learn more about Google Cloud’s free tier

Note: After the free credits are used or expire, continued usage of billable services requires enabling billing on your Google Cloud account. Charges only apply if you choose to continue using paid services.
