- [Get messages and attestations](https://developers.circle.com/api-reference/cctp/all/get-messages-v2.md): Retrieves messages and attestations for a given transaction hash or nonce. Each message for a given transaction hash is ordered by ascending log index.
- [List attestation public keys](https://developers.circle.com/api-reference/cctp/all/get-public-keys.md): Retrieves a list of the currently active public keys for verifying attestation signatures.
- [Get public keys](https://developers.circle.com/api-reference/cctp/all/get-public-keys-v2.md): Returns the public keys for validating attestations across all supported versions of CCTP.
- [Re-attest a pre-finality message](https://developers.circle.com/api-reference/cctp/all/reattest-message.md): The re-attestation flow allows the relayer to obtain a higher level of finality than was originally requested on the source chain, while still being forced to pay the fee since allowance was reserved.

- [Create a CUBIX bank account](https://developers.circle.com/api-reference/circle-mint/account/create-business-cubix-account.md)
- [Create a deposit address](https://developers.circle.com/api-reference/circle-mint/account/create-business-deposit-address.md): Generates a new blockchain address for a wallet for a given currency/chain pair. Circle may reuse addresses on blockchains that support reuse. For example, if you're requesting two addresses for depositing USD and ETH, both on Ethereum, you may see the same Ethereum address returned. Depositing cryptocurrency to a generated address will credit the associated wallet with the value of the deposit. Note: Circle Mint Singapore customers must verify all transfer recipients using the UI in the Circle Console, as transfers from unverified addresses will be held in `pending` status.

- [Accelerate a stuck transaction](https://developers.circle.com/api-reference/cpn/cpn-platform/accelerate-transaction.md): - Accelerate a transaction based on the payment ID. It should be used when a transaction associated with the payment is broadcasted but not confirmed for a long period of time (i.e 10 minutes). This is usually due to gas fees being too low and not picked up by any miner/validator.

- The /accelerate endpoint essentially creates another transaction with the same params as the broadcasted transaction. If multiple broadcasted transactions exist, it will use the newest created one. Afterwards, OFI can sign with a higher gas fee and submit via /submit endpoint to accelerate blockchain confirmation.

- Requirements for using this endpoint:

  - No COMPLETED transaction exist for the payment (otherwise onchain transaction has completed)

  - No CREATED transaction exist for the payment, otherwise OFI should sign that transaction and submit

  - No PENDING transaction exist for the payment, otherwise OFI should wait for transaction to be broadcasted

- In another word, all existing transaction for the payment should either be FAILED (which is no longer effective) or BROADCASTED (which means they are stuck onchain and not confirmed)

- [Create a payment](https://developers.circle.com/api-reference/cpn/cpn-platform/create-payment.md): Creates a payment by using the quote created previously and submitting recipient information (travel rule).

If the BFI initiates an RFI after the payment is created, the OFI will be notified via webhook. This webhook will detail what specific information the OFI needs to send. 

After receiving the webhook. The OFI is expected to encrypt the requested data and send it to the BFI using CPN's RFI submit endpoint. Failure to respond to an RFI will result in a failed payment. The OFI will receive webhooks with the decision based on the submitted information.
